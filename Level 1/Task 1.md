Markdown is an easy-to-use markup language that is used with plain text to add formatting elements (headings, bulleted lists, URLs) to plain text without the use of a formal text editor or the use of HTML tags. Markdown is device agnostic and displays the writing format consistently across device type. Write a technical resource article on a topic of your choice and post it on the MARVEL website. Refer to the linked article for further details

## TASK 9: Tinkercad
```
Create a tinkercad account, get familiar with the application, understand the example circuits given and simulate a simple circuit using an ultrasonic sensor to estimate the distance between an obstacle and the sensor. Display the results on the serial monitor.

Create a radar system utilising an ultrasonic sensor and servo motor to detect objects within a certain range. The ultrasonic sensor emits sound waves and measures the time taken for them to bounce back, while the servo motor rotates the sensor to cover a wider area, providing a simple yet effective detection mechanism.
